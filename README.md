# Breast-Cancer-Dectection-using-various-ML-algorithm
Machine learning algorithms have shown promise in aiding breast cancer detection and diagnosis by analyzing medical imaging data.
. Here I used  some ways machine learning is applied in breast cancer detection like Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-NeighborsClassifier,  Decision Tree Classifier, Guassian Navie Baye's, Support Vector Classifier.
